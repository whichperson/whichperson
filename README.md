This repository contains a bunch of my stuff. I like to make obscure software nobody uses. Ocassionally, I'll try to create a project and open-source it but ultimately ditch it after I get bored. Right now, I'm sick and tired of the housing market crisis in NL because I want to move away from the shithole where I live so I'm attempting to find a solution. 

If you got any ideas, send them my way. I will steal them and never give you credit because I'm the worst person you'll ever meet.
