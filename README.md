### Wh-
ich person? Me! I like to create obscure things (that sometimes turn out to be useful 🤫) and tinker around with anything that catches my eye. For legal purposes, I'm a software engineer but for my own I am a mad scientist/mouse who wants to take over the world. Wait, isn't that the plot of Pinky & the Brain? Yes, great taste in cartoons!
