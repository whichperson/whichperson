### Hey, Stranger! 

I'm a software developer who's passionate about finding ways of optimizing the human experience with technology. To quote my favorite movie character: *"You can always be thinner, look better"* **(sarcasm)**. 

I'm currently focusing on building VR environments for mental rehabilitation and writing my thesis in `org-mode`: "A gamified recommender system to stimulate cognitive function in children with dementia".

#### Work
- Software Developer @ Cofano in Enschede, Netherlands
- System Architect & Data Scientist at Tusk, an open source anti-poaching project sponsored by the Ghanaian government
- Data Scientist & Programmer @ Lara Bay Turtle Conservation Station in Limassol, Cyprus

#### Previous Work
- Student Data Scientist @ TRIMM in Enschede, Netherlands

#### Personal Work
- Waggle: super secret project
- Creed: real-time desktop emulator for note editing & collaboration
- Poppi: VR environments for mental illness patients

#### Recreational Activities
Besides programming, I love to do other stuff: run (away from my problems), swim, dance, paint, read, teach myself new languages, make Spotify playlists...

A few highlights.
- Reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath
- Fiddling with emacs
- Learning about UI/UX design and human psychology
- Playing Stardew Valley on my days off
- Photographing my dogs, farm animals at my family's farm, sleeping grandpa and everything else I love
- Trying to leave my house more often
