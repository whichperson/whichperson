On paper, I'm a full-stack software engineer. That's how I make my bread; a little anorthodox considering my ancestors were actual bakers. When I'm not under capitalistic oath, I retreat into my garden and plant flowers. Currently, I'm busy paving paths around my garden so people can reach it.

<span>If you'd like to be part of my garden, send me a buzzing bee. </span>

<h4>Garden? This is a code repository.</h4>

Oops, you caught me! Here's a list of things I like tinkering with right now.


- Artificial intelligence (applications in healthcare)

- Virtual reality environments and human-computer interaction (research)

- Microcontrollers and system architecture

- Music, art, literature, travel, sports (mens sana in corpore sano)

- Not gardening
